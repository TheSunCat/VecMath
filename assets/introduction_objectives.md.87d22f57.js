Transformations, angle calculations, path planning, rendering, ... would be impossible without this tapistry of mathematical operation.</p></li><li><p>Programming : <code>\u201DCreatio ex nihilo\u201D</code> - as programmers, we create something out of nothing and we literally make our dreams come true. Programming is a fine art where you use just your brain to think something into existance.</p></li><li><p>Programming Language design : I designed the language myself, and with the help of the ANLTR tool (<a href="http://antlr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://antlr.org</a>) I created implementations for C++ and Java. Designing your own programming language is an exhilarating experience and it is very rewarding to see your own programming language function and calculate things. As such, I hope that apart from my personal satisfation this vecmath tool helps you with vector math calculations. These calculations are typically cumbersome and error prone and this tool aims to help by having dedicated and simple instructions to perform these operations.</p></li></ul>',3),r=[n];function s(l,c,h,m,p,g){return t(),a("div",null,r)}var _=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,_ as default};
